// Breadth-first search in a graph
// Depth-first search in a graph (augment it to detect cycles)
// Tree traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
// Topological sort (using Tarjan’s algorithm)
// Dijkstra’s algorithm (without decrease-key)
// Longest common subsequence (using dynamic programming with matrices)
// Knapsack problem (also dynamic programming)
// - Know how to identify and solve backtracking problems. Loads of first technical phone screens on Collab-edit type environments were backtracking problems.
